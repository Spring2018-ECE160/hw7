## Question 3

Use the hash map struct that we created in class to find the intersection (common elements) between two arrays of integers. Your function prototype should be:  
<code>void intersection(int output[], int array1[], int array2[]);</code>  

Alternatively, you can also pass in the lengths of the arrays:
<code>void intersection(int output[], int array1[], int lenArr1, int array2[], int lenArr2);</code> 

Show that your function works with a few examples.

Compile Steps:

Output:
